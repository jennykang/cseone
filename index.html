	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>From typical COMP course projects to the final-year projects, a very interesting pattern usually occurs: Groups are usually formed among local students, or formed by international students with similar nationality or cultural background. <br><br>

	To address this issue, a discussion group composing of local and international students was formed in Spring 2014. After a few iterations of discussion, we found out that cultural difference is only one of the symptoms.  Students having similar ethic background usually share a similar mindset, and thus they are more eager to work with each other. This group setting is usually very efficient to solve well-defined problems, such as course projects. <br><br>

	However, solving real-life problems usually need creativity. CSE One strongly believes that creativity is originated by thoughtful discussion among members with diversified backgrounds.  We believe that our ongoing activities, such as CSE TechShare, can help connect students from different backgrounds. We would also like to take this opportunity to build a family-like environment within the CSE community.  </p>

				<p>The meaning of living maybe vague and different for many people. And Popo believes that whatever it is, leaving a sparkle of light of your own in other people's hearts is the most important. Being isolated in high school, Popo was a very shy introvert. However, she is thankful for this experience as she could see how a small action can enlighten a person for a day! Through the training for Engineering Student Ambassador and experience in being peer mentor and committee member (and sometimes founder) for several organizations, she explores herself and enriches her personalities. Nonetheless, she still remembers the time without the help of anyone and hopes to make a difference in UST. That's why she is fond of founding CSE One, in wish of gathering CSE students, helping each other, building a community together, and neglect the language or cultural barrior, that no one is ever left alone</p></td>

				<p>Lance was born in Indonesia, but moved to Hong Kong at the age on nine. Thus technically, he is both "international" and "local" student. Thus, he understand the difficulties of international students on interacting with local communities. On his first few day at HKUST, he pranked various student society members by answering their promotion in English.Surprisingly , most of the promoter gave up communicating and left.
				After being invited by Peter to join, he was motivated by the goal of CSE One and accepted without hesitations and seek to close the communication gap between locals and non locals.</p></td>

				<p>That’s how we should start an introduction to CSE One as all the members of this group are here to do their best to its followers. Justinas, or just Justin, is only one of CSE One persons who are passionate about helping other people to get involved in the fast-moving world of technology. Justinas was never interested in something like that in his earlier days (very early days, like 15 years ago), but the first access to the motherboard of a computer had influenced him so that he came to HKUST to study Electronic Engineering. However, one JAVA program (experience in the Pascal programming language was not that effective) and Justinas had to change his priorities over his future at HKUST. As a result, he’s been combining his love for hardware and software in the Computer Engineering program for three years at HKUST, and he’s been a member of CSE One since it was founded.</p></td>

				<p>Ankith, is a very friendly, fun loving and innovative person and he is also one of the founding fathers of CSE One. He is very positive and believes in unity between students of different nations and backgrounds, hence he came up with the name "CSE One”. He has participated in programming competitions and volunteered for helping children with autism. He is presently working on an app project for Hearing Impaired Children. He is also working on his own app(CabSplit), for taxi sharing in Hong Kong.

However, after learning the C language during her leisure time, she grew very fond of the study and decided that she wanted to continue learning programming. Today she is fully immersed in the field of computer science and loves to try out new stuff within related to it. 
				She decided to join and support CSE One because she wanted to contribute to the CSE community. She also wanted to help bridge the gap between the local and the non-local students. </p></td>

He plays clarinet, electric/acoustic and bass guitar and sings too. He was motivated by the CSE One goal as he tried to participate in several societies in HKUST but failed because he does not speak any Cantonese. He believes it is very important for both local and non-local students to form one true society. He also thinks CSE One will be able to hold an important role to make the two separate societies to become so.</p></td>

			<p> Hey guys, 

			My name is Sathish. I am a final year student majoring in Computer Science. Since I have way too much free time, I also double-minor in Entrepreneurship and Social Science.<br><br>

			My last three odd years at HKUST have been most exciting and adventurous. I have conducted research in MIT, interned at Microsoft, visited eight countries and met some very inspiring people. I have also been part of some exciting initiatives in HKUST including Hong Kong Debate Open, Great Minds, TEDxHKUST, Live Green LLC and SIGHT. At CSE One, Stephen and I will focus on our combined work at SIGHT and the potential we see in it to transform medicare in the developing world.<br><br>

			<p> Hello guys! I am a year three student majoring in computer science. I am also a founding member of SIGHT.
			AS a computer science student, I always want to find a way to apply my programming skills in a meaningful way.
			Last summer, I and my SIGHT teammates visited a Cambodian NGO "one-2-one" to see whether we can help them by
			using our engineering knowledge. I have found that we actually can do a lot in helping the poor, e.g. developing
			software system. Learning through practice. I hope more and more computer science students can gather together to develop
			meaningful project. No matter you are new to programming or an expert in programming, we can always learn from each other.
			See you in CSE ONE!</p></td>

Then i will talk about my present work, 1) working for app development for hearing impaired children. Then i will also talk about how Computer Science can open the gates to numerous self made opportunities and how i am working on my idea for CabSplit.

			<p>The workshop will be a hands on implementation of a RESFful app.
				First part of the workshop will be introducing the cloud server setup (with Openshift and Ruby on Rails).

				The second part is integrating cloud server with Android application. Knowing that not all participants can build a server in limited time. I will provide them with an testing api (an Api getting UST course information and quota) and let them try to build a real android application (sample code will be provided as ref.).<br><br>

				Prerequisites:
				<ul>
					<li>Basic knowledge on JAVA (Sample code will also be provided for those who are not comfortable with JAVA)</li>
					<li>Need to bring their laptop (MacBook / Linux preferred. If an error occurs, it would be very hard to fix on a Windows environment)</li>
